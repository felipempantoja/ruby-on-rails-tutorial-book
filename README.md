# Rails Sample App

> Reference: Ruby on Rails Tutorial's Book, from Hartl

The idea behind the book is introducing the reader to the Rails ecosystem, by
guiding us to a series of well explained snippets so we can end up with a Twitter-Like
Sample App to create posts and follow users. It also encourages the use of TDD
practice and use it in all examples from beginning to the very end. The test
library used is RScpec alongside Capybara for Acceptance Tests.
